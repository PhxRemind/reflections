What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creates the .git file so you can track the history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the middleman before committing.  Repository contains the files and .git file.
Provides a check point for your work.

Staging :

Git add "file name"
git commit 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git --staged. Compares the staging with the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Use branches to create alternate versions that probably wont go into the main master file.

Branches : 

git branch 
git branch 'argument'  creates a new branch 
git checkout 'argument'  Changes which branch you are on, shows a * next to the main one.
git log --graph --oneline master coins This will display the lines of changes on both branches.
git checkout -b 'new branch name'

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
